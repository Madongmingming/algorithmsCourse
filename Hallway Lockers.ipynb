    "You are in a hallway lined with 100 lockers. You start with one pass and open the lockers, so that the *opened* lockers are now with their doors opened out. You begin by closing **every second** locker. Then you go to close **every third** locker and **close it if it is open or open it if it’s closed** — we will refer to this as \"toggling\" the lockers. You continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n. After your hundredth pass of the hallway, in which you toggle only locker number 100, how many lockers are open?\n"
