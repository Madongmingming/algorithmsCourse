    "A group of four travelers comes to a bridge at night. The bridge can hold the weight of at most only two of the travelers at a time, and it can- not be crossed without using a flashlight. \n",
    "\n",
    "The travelers have one flashlight among them. Each traveler walks at a different speed: The first can cross the bridge in 1 minute, the second in 2 minutes, the third in 5 minutes, and the fourth takes 10 minutes to cross the bridge. If two travelers cross together, they walk at the speed of the slower traveler.\n",
